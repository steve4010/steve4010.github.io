I installed the PaperMod theme on Hugo.

These are random notes on settings, etc.

## Tags and Categories in Posts

I had seen some examples of laying out the array like this: tags: [ tag1, tag2, etc ]

I might have been doing it wrong but I coulndt get it to work like that.

Below is what worked for me.

The post tags and categories array in the post front matter:

tags:
- tag1
- tag2
 
categories:
- category1
- category2
